 * This dataset can be made available for querying with SQL (explore). This is enabled through dataset
 * properties when the dataset is created. See {@link FileSetProperties}
 * for details. If it is enabled for explore, a Hive external table will be created when the dataset is
 * created. The Hive table is partitioned by the same keys as this dataset.
