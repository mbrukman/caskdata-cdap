 *
 * This dataset can be made available for querying with SQL (explore). This is enabled through dataset
 * properties when the dataset is created. See {@link co.cask.cdap.api.dataset.lib.FileSetProperties}
 * for details. If it is enabled for explore, a Hive external table will be created when the dataset is
 * created. The Hive table is partitioned by year, month, day, hour and minute.
