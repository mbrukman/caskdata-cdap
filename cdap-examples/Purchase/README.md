# Purchase example

Example application that reads purchase data from a Stream, processes the data via a Workflow,
and makes it available via ad-hoc querying and the RESTful interface of a Service.

Features introduced: Custom Dataset with ad-hoc querying capability, Workflow, and MapReduce.

- Uses a scheduled Workflow to start a MapReduce that reads from one ObjectStore Dataset and
  writes to another. The application also demonstrates using ad-hoc SQL queries.

  - Send sentences of the form "Tom bought 5 apples for $10" to the purchaseStream.
  - The PurchaseFlow reads the purchaseStream and converts every input String into a
    Purchase object and stores the object in the purchases Dataset.
  - When scheduled by the PurchaseHistoryWorkFlow, the PurchaseHistoryBuilder MapReduce
    program reads the purchases Dataset, creates a purchase history, and stores the purchase
    history in the history Dataset every morning at 4:00 A.M. You can manually (on the
    Process page in the CDAP Console) or programmatically execute the
    PurchaseHistoryBuilder MapReduce to store customers' purchase history in the
    history Dataset.
  - Request the ``PurchaseHistoryService`` retrieve from the *history* Dataset the purchase history of a user.
  - You can use SQL to formulate ad-hoc queries over the history Dataset. This is done by
    a series of ``curl`` calls, as described in the RESTful API section of the Developer Guide.

- Note: Because, by default, the PurchaseHistoryWorkFlow process doesn't run until 4:00 A.M.,
  instead of waiting you can manually or programmatically execute the
  PurcaseHistoryBuilder) after entering the first customers' purchases or the PurchaseQuery
  will return a "not found" error.
