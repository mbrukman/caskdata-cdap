===========
Hello World
===========

The simplest Cask Data Application Platform (CDAP) Example.

Overview
===========

This application uses one Stream, one Dataset, one Flow and one Service to implement the classic "Hello World".

- A stream to send names to;
- A flow with a single flowlet that reads the stream and stores in a dataset each name in a KeyValueTable; and
- A Service, that reads the name from the KeyValueTable and responds with "Hello [Name]!"


The ``HelloWorld`` Application
-------------------------------

.. literalinclude:: /../../../cdap-examples/HelloWorld/src/main/java/co/cask/cdap/examples/helloworld/HelloWorld.java
   :language: java
   :lines: 40-58
   
The application uses a stream called *who* to ingest data through a flow *WhoFlow* to a dataset *whom*.

The ``WhoFlow``
---------------

This is a trivial flow with a single flowlet named *saver* of type ``NameSaver``:

.. literalinclude:: /../../../cdap-examples/HelloWorld/src/main/java/co/cask/cdap/examples/helloworld/HelloWorld.java
   :language: java
   :lines: 63-74
   
The flowlet uses a dataset of type ``KeyValueTable`` to store the names it reads from the stream. Every time a new
name is received, it is stored in the table under the key ``name``-and it overwrites any name that was previously
stored:

.. literalinclude:: /../../../cdap-examples/HelloWorld/src/main/java/co/cask/cdap/examples/helloworld/HelloWorld.java
   :language: java
   :lines: 79-100
  
Note that the flowlet also emits metrics: every time a name longer than 10 characters is received,
the counter ``names.longnames`` is incremented by one, and the metric ``names.bytes`` is incremented
by the length of the name. We will see below how to retrieve these metrics using the 
:ref:`http-restful-api-metrics`.

The ``Greeting`` Service
------------------------------

This Service has a single endpoint called ``greet`` that does not accept arguments. When invoked, it
reads the name stored by the ``NameSaver`` from the key-value table. It return a simple greeting with that name:

.. literalinclude:: /../../../cdap-examples/HelloWorld/src/main/java/co/cask/cdap/examples/helloworld/HelloWorld.java
   :language: java
   :lines: 105-137

Note that the Service, like the Flowlet, also emits metrics: every time the name *Jane Doe* is received,
the counter ``greetings.count.jane_doe`` is incremented by one.
We will see below how to retrieve this metric using the
:ref:`http-restful-api-metrics`.

Building and Starting
=================================

- You can either build the example (as described `below
  <#building-an-example-application>`__) or use the pre-built JAR file included in the CDAP SDK.
- Start CDAP, deploy and start the application and its components as described below in 
  `Running CDAP Applications`_\ .
  Make sure you start the Flow and Service as described below.
- Once the application has been deployed and started, you can `run the example. <#running-the-example>`__

Running CDAP Applications
============================================

.. include:: /../../developers-manual/build/_includes/building-apps-versioned.rst
   :start-line: 9

Running the Example
===================

Starting the Flow
------------------------------

Once the application is deployed:

- Click on the *Process* button in the left sidebar of the CDAP Console,
  then click ``WhoFlow`` in the *Process* page to get to the
  Flow detail page, then click the *Start* button; or
- From the Standalone CDAP SDK directory, use the Command Line Interface:

  .. list-table::
    :widths: 20 80
    :stub-columns: 1

    * - On Linux:
      - ``$ ./bin/cdap-cli.sh start flow HelloWorld.WhoFlow``
    * - On Windows:
      - ``> bin\cdap-cli.bat start flow HelloWorld.WhoFlow``    

Starting the Service
------------------------------

Once the application is deployed:

- Click on ``HelloWorld`` in the Overview page of the CDAP Console to get to the
  Application detail page, click ``Greeting`` in the *Service* pane to get to the
  Service detail page, then click the *Start* button; or
- From the Standalone CDAP SDK directory, use the Command Line Interface:

  .. list-table::
    :widths: 20 80
    :stub-columns: 1

    * - On Linux:
      - ``$ ./bin/cdap-cli.sh start service HelloWorld.Greeting``
    * - On Windows:
      - ``> bin\cdap-cli.bat start service HelloWorld.Greeting``    

Injecting a Name
------------------------------

In the Application's detail page, under *Process*, click on *WhoFlow*. This takes you to
the flow details page. (If you haven't already started the Flow, click on the *Start*
button in the right-side, below the green arrow.) The Flow's label will read *Running*
when it is ready to receive events.

Now click on the *who* Stream on the left side of the flow visualization, which brings up
a pop-up window. Enter a name and click the *Inject* button. After you close the pop-up
window, you will see that the counters for both the Stream and the *saver* Flowlet
increase to 1. You can repeat this step to enter more names, but remember that only the
last name is stored in the key-value table.

Using the Service
------------------------------

Go back to the Application's detail page, and under Service, click on the *Greeting*
service. (If you haven't already started the Service, click on the *Start* button in the
right-side, below the green arrow.) The Service's label will read *Running* when it is
ready to receive events.

Now you can make a request to the service using curl::

  $ curl -w '\n' http://localhost:10000/v2/apps/HelloWorld/services/Greeting/methods/greet

If the last name you entered was *Tom*, the Service will respond with ``Hello Tom!``

**Note:** A version of ``curl`` that works with Windows is included in the CDAP Standalone
SDK in ``libexec\bin\curl.exe``
  
Retrieving Metrics
------------------------------

.. highlight:: console

You can now query the metrics that are emitted by the flow. To see the value of the ``names.bytes`` metric,
you can make an HTTP request to the :ref:`http-restful-api-metrics` using curl::

  $ curl -w '\n' http://localhost:10000/v2/metrics/user/apps/HelloWorld/flows/WhoFlow/flowlets/saver/names.bytes?aggregate=true
  {"data":3}

To see the value of the ``names.longnames`` metric (the number of names greater than 10 characters),
you can use::

  $ curl -w '\n' http://localhost:10000/v2/metrics/user/apps/HelloWorld/flows/WhoFlow/flowlets/saver/names.longnames?aggregate=true
  {"data":2}
  
To see the value of the ``greetings.count.jane_doe`` metric (the number of times the name *Jane Doe* has been seen),
you can use::

  $ curl -w '\n' http://localhost:10000/v2/metrics/user/apps/HelloWorld/services/Greeting/greetings.count.jane_doe?aggregate=true
  {"data":0}
  
Stopping the Application
-------------------------------
Once done, you can stop the application as described above in `Stopping an Application. 
<#stopping-an-application>`__ Here is an example-specific description of the steps:

**Stopping the Flow**

- Click on the *Process* button in the left sidebar of the CDAP Console,
  then click ``WhoFlow`` in the *Process* page to get to the
  Flow detail page, then click the *Stop* button; or
- From the Standalone CDAP SDK directory, use the Command Line Interface:

  .. list-table::
    :widths: 20 80
    :stub-columns: 1

    * - On Linux:
      - ``$ ./bin/cdap-cli.sh stop flow HelloWorld.WhoFlow``
    * - On Windows:
      - ``> bin\cdap-cli.bat stop flow HelloWorld.WhoFlow``    

**Stopping the Service**

- Click on ``HelloWorld`` in the Overview page of the CDAP Console to get to the
  Application detail page, click ``Greeting`` in the *Service* pane to get to the
  Service detail page, then click the *Stop* button; or
- From the Standalone CDAP SDK directory, use the Command Line Interface:

  .. list-table::
    :widths: 20 80
    :stub-columns: 1

    * - On Linux:
      - ``$ ./bin/cdap-cli.sh stop service HelloWorld.Greeting``
    * - On Windows:
      - ``> bin\cdap-cli.bat stop service HelloWorld.Greeting``
