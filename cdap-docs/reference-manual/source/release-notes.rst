`Release 2.6.1 <http://docs.cask.co/cdap/2.6.1/index.html>`__
=============================================================

CDAP Bug Fixes
--------------
- Allow an *unchecked Dataset upgrade* upon application deployment
  (`CDAP-1253 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-1253>`__).
- Update the Hive Dataset table when a Dataset is updated
  (`CDAP-71 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-71>`__).
- Use Hadoop configuration files bundled with the Explore Service
  (`CDAP-1250 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-1250>`__).

.. _known-issues-261:

Known Issues
------------
- See also the *Known Issues* of `version 2.6.0. <#known-issues-260>`_

- Typically, Datasets are bundled as part of Applications. When an Application is upgraded and redeployed,
  any changes in Datasets will not be redeployed. This is because Datasets can be shared across applications,
  and an incompatible schema change can break other applications that are using the Dataset.
  A workaround (`CDAP-1253 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-1253>`__) is to allow *unchecked Dataset upgrades*.
  Upgrades cause the Dataset metadata, i.e. its specification including properties, to be updated. The Dataset
  runtime code is also updated. To prevent data loss the existing data and the underlying HBase tables remain as-is.

  You can allow *unchecked Dataset upgrades* by setting the configuration property ``dataset.unchecked.upgrade``
  to ``true`` in ``cdap-site.xml``. This will ensure that Datasets are upgraded when the Application is redeployed.
  When this configuration is set, the recommended process to deploy an upgraded Dataset is to first stop
  all Applications that are using the Dataset before deploying the new version of the Application.
  This lets all containers (Flows, Services, etc) to pick up the new Dataset changes.
  When Datasets are upgraded using ``dataset.unchecked.upgrade``, no schema compatibility checks are performed by the
  system. Hence it is very important that the developer verify the backward-compatibility, and makes sure that
  other Applications that are using the Dataset can work with the new changes.


`Release 2.6.0 <http://docs.cask.co/cdap/2.6.0/index.html>`__
=============================================================

API Changes
-----------
-  API for specifying Services and MapReduce programs has been changed to use a "configurer" 
   style; this will require modification of user classes implementing either MapReduce
   or Service as the interfaces have changed (`CDAP-335

  - Added an HTTP endpoint that lists all Services
    (`CDAP-469 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-469>`__).
  - Default metrics for Services have been added to the CDAP Console
    (`CDAP-512 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-512>`__).
  - The annotations ``@QueryParam`` and ``@DefaultValue`` are now supported in custom Service handlers
    (`CDAP-664 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-664>`__).

CDAP Bug Fixes
--------------

- Fixed a problem with readless increments not being used when they were enabled in a Dataset
  (`CDAP-383 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-383>`__).
- Fixed a problem with applications, whose Spark or Scala user classes were not extended
  from either ``JavaSparkProgram`` or ``ScalaSparkProgram``, failing with a class loading error
  (`CDAP-599 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-599>`__).
- Fixed a problem with the :ref:`CDAP upgrade tool <install-upgrade>` not preserving—for 
  tables with readless increments enabled—the coprocessor configuration during an upgrade
  (`CDAP-1044 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-1044>`__).
- Fixed a problem with the readless increment implementation dropping increment cells when 
  a region flush or compaction occurred (`CDAP-1062 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-1062>`__).

.. _known-issues-260:

Known Issues
------------

- When running secure Hadoop clusters, metrics and debug logs from MapReduce programs are
  not available (`CDAP-64 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-64>`__ and `CDAP-797
  <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-797>`__).
- When upgrading a cluster from an earlier version of CDAP, warning messages may appear in
  the master log indicating that in-transit (emitted, but not yet processed) metrics
  system messages could not be decoded (*Failed to decode message to MetricsRecord*). This
  is because of a change in the format of emitted metrics, and can result in a small
  amount of metrics data points being lost (`CDAP-745
  <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-745>`__).
- Writing to datasets through Hive is not supported in CDH4.x
  (`CDAP-988 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-988>`__).
- A race condition resulting in a deadlock can occur when a TwillRunnable container
  shutdowns while it still has Zookeeper events to process. This occasionally surfaces when
  running with OpenJDK or JDK7, though not with Oracle JDK6. It is caused by a change in the
  ``ThreadPoolExecutor`` implementation between Oracle JDK6 and OpenJDK/JDK7. Until Twill is
  updated in a future version of CDAP, a work-around is to kill the errant process. The Yarn
  command to list all running applications and their ``app-id``\s is::
  
    yarn application -list -appStates RUNNING

  The command to kill a process is::
  
    yarn application -kill <app-id>
    
  All versions of CDAP running Twill version 0.4.0 with this configuration can exhibit this
  problem (`TWILL-110 <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TWILL-110>`__).


`Release 2.5.2 <http://docs.cask.co/cdap/2.5.2/index.html>`__
=============================================================

CDAP Bug Fixes
--------------

- Fixed a problem with a Coopr-provisioned secure cluster failing to start due to a classpath
  issue (`CDAP-478 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-478>`__).
- Fixed a problem with the WISE app zip distribution not packaged correctly; a new version
  (0.2.1) has been released (`CDAP-533 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-533>`__).
- Fixed a problem with the examples and tests incorrectly using the ByteBuffer.array
  method when reading a Stream event (`CDAP-549 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-549>`__).
- Fixed a problem with the Authentication Server so that it can now communicate with an LDAP
  instance over SSL (`CDAP-556 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-556>`__).
- Fixed a problem with the program class loader to allow applications to use a different
  version of a library than the one that the CDAP platform uses; for example, a different
  Kafka library (`CDAP-559 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-559>`__).
- Fixed a problem with CDAP master not obtaining new delegation tokens after running for 
  ``hbase.auth.key.update.interval`` milliseconds (`CDAP-562 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-562>`__).
- Fixed a problem with the transaction not being rolled back when a user service handler throws an exception 
  (`CDAP-607 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-607>`__).

Other Changes
-------------

- Improved the CDAP documentation:

  - Re-organized the documentation into three manuals—Developers' Manual, Administration
    Manual, Reference Manual—and a set of examples, how-to guides and tutorials;
  - Documents are now in smaller chapters, with numerous updates and revisions;
  - Added a link for downloading an archive of the documentation for offline use;
  - Added links to examples relevant to a particular component;
  - Added suggested deployment architectures for Distributed CDAP installations;
  - Added a glossary;
  - Added navigation aids at the bottom of each page; and
  - Tested and updated the Standalone CDAP examples and their documentation.

Known Issues
------------
- Currently, applications that include Spark or Scala classes in user classes not extended
  from either ``JavaSparkProgram`` or ``ScalaSparkProgram`` (depending upon the language)
  fail with a class loading error. Spark or Scala classes should not be used outside of the
  Spark program. (`CDAP-599 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-599>`__)
